Verbatim is an AI-powered web interface allowing English-Language Learners to assess the difficulty level of a text according to the CEFR scale. 

It provides the user with two options to evaluate the difficulty level of a text of their choosing:
- a machine learning model (Naive Bayes);
- a deep learning model (GRU).

The dataset used for the training of the models is comprised of labelled literary and news texts. To account for the constraints attached to each model, a tailored preprocessing has however been adopted before training.
